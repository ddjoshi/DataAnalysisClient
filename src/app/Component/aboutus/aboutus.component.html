        <strong>"Don't just do something because it's a trendy idea and will make you a lot of money. The reason I say that is because any kind of venture involves going through difficult times. If you're doing something you are passionate about and really believe in, then that will carry you through," said American businessman Jerry Greenfield.</strong></p>
  <p>For a financial portal born in late 1999, just when bursting of the dotcom bubble was about to nearly bring down both financial markets and the fledgling worldwide web, we couldn't have chosen a more difficult time to launch. But it was really passion and belief that saw us through. A single-minded passion to become the country's greatest resource for financial information on the Internet. And the belief, that through it, we would be able to make a difference to people's financial lives.
  Since 1999 through to today we have been there to chronicle the growth of the Indian economy. And along with it we have grown as well ; starting off as a financial portal that began by offering end-of-day stock prices to today arguably becoming India's biggest store of news (text and videos), analysis, data and tools on investing (across diverse asset classes), personal finance, the business sector and the economy.
  moneycontrol.com today gets over 17 million visitors every month across all its platforms-web, mobile and tablets that makes it the largest online financial platform in India. But while we've radically changed and evolved, the belief and passion to be the best and the most insightful hasn't. That, we hope, keeps us ticking. This we believe is merely the start of our journey.
